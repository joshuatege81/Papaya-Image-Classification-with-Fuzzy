# Papaya-Image-Classification-with-Fuzzy
Classified the papaya fruit using fuzzy method. The GUI are using website service with HTML &amp; Flask Library of python.

### Notes:

- Fuzzy.rar is a folder that how I do a research about Fuzzy classification. How can I get the best parameter in in there. You can try your own research in there. Just extract it and begin
- All files with .py format are the code for this this Project. Run web.py to start the web for Papaya classification
- uploads folder are the dataset for model training
- fuzzy.py are the fuzzy paramter for this project
- hemo.py are the image extraction for the dataset

## Step by step how to use it

- The required libraries are pandas, numpy, cv2, tqdm, and skfuzzy
- Run the web.py file with your python
- And type http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict to your browser
